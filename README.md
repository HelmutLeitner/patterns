## What is this about ?

This is part of an effort to 
- mine refine co-creative patterns 
- build pattern languages and generative sequences as defined by Christopher Alexander.

## What are patterns ?

Patterns are proven solutions to recurring problems that occurs within certain context.

This is an attempt to identify not just clever solutions expressed in a neat pattern format but rather deep/generative/living patterns, that will help produce living systems. One of the criteria being to which extend the patterns let our inner forces loose. 
> "The specific patterns out of which a town is made may be alive or dead. to the extent they are alive, they let our inner force loose and set us free; but when they are dead, they keep us locked in inner conflict." C.Alexander

## Generative sequence: patterns 2.0

patterns are static, like a snapshot of a dynamic reality. As such they are not useful to build something, but rather a guide to evaluate what has been built and if it's rich.

To build things up, we need generative sequence, a step-by-step set of instructions designed so the intelligence is in the process and therefore anyone can unconsciously design something great without much technical expertise.

Generative sequences can't be assembled but they themselves have to be generated and refined step by step

## How you can contribute ?

Because these patterns and generative sequences needs to be evolved and refined step by step, it is interesting that this becomes a collective work.

A list of raw patterns is available in the pattern mining area and will be refine before being moved to invidual files.

The documents are stored on Github whose technology allow for forking and merging easily content. In plain language it means you can copy and make your own version of the document, add the modifications you want and it might be merged back into the original document. or not.

Basically this allows for decentralized collaboration where everyone can feed of each other, but collaboration happens without having to negociate consensus as different versions can coexist.

This way you can make your own custom patterns language, while at the same time maeking it easy for anyone to reuse your contributions.

To get started you need a github account and click on the small pen icon on the top left of the text. The files are formated using markdown.
